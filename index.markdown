I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [Guest Group](http://engineeringforsustainability.com)
laboratory at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](http://illinois.edu).
I create and leverage tools to design, simulate, and perform techno-economic 
analysis and life cycle assessment of biorefineries. Using automated biorefinery 
models, I perform rigorous uncertainty and sensitivity analyses to navigate 
trade-offs and charter development roadmaps for emerging and conceptual 
technologies.  Iâ€™m the lead developer of [BioSTEAM](https://github.com/BioSTEAMDevelopmentGroup/biosteam)
and core contributor to [Caleb Bell](https://github.com/CalebBell)'s [chemicals](https://github.com/CalebBell/chemicals)
library.
